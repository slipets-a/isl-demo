              <h3 class="uppercase">2. Supply of Service</h3>
              <p>
                The service facilitates communication between you and a hearing person
                whom you wish to speak with, through a qualified British Sign Language
                interpreter, for a paid fee. The service is delivered over the
                InSignLanguage app, which is instantly accessible and is therefore
                chargeable on the time during which the app is connected to the
                interpreter. The service is only available to registered users who
                have completed registration and accepted these terms and conditions.
                We endeavour to deliver a high level of service that satisfies your
                requirements. We are responsible for providing you with qualified
                interpreters that can be contacted and seen, via Video Relay Service
                (VRS) as featured on our app.
              </p>
              <p>
                All users must be logged into the InSignLanguage server via the app.
                This requires that InSignLanguage store your personal details. All
                information pertaining to the log-in and registration is subject to
                the General Data Protection Regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our service is based and operated totally from the U.K. with
                translations from spoken English into BSL and vice versa. Service is
                offered live with our vetted, valued and qualified interpreters, who
                will be suitably visible on screen for signing, body language and
                expressions. The user experience is designed to give a good and clear
                understanding to the deaf and hearing parties in the conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Messaging and sign video services are conducted via the app to enable
                communication to be translated from BSL into English.
              </p>
              <h3 class="uppercase">3. VRS Delivery target</h3>

              </p>
              <p>
                We aim to ensure that the service is always available to You during
                our opening hours, however, given that access to the Service is via
                the internet, we cannot guarantee absolute Service availability as
                this is fully reliant upon working internet connections.
              </p>
              <h3 class="uppercase">4. Devices</h3>
              <p>
                Our booking and video system operate on the internet and is accessible
                on PCs and laptops as well as via Apps on both iOS and Android
                devices. Access to the Video Relay Service requires Wi-Fi or, if Wi-Fi
                is not available, a strong data connection is required in order for
                the service to be used.
              </p>
              <h3 class="uppercase">5. Charges</h3>
              <p>
                Use of the service through the app is charged per minute used. This is
                a pay per use service that requires a debit or credit card to be
                registered. This service is provided by Stripe. There is also a
                subscription service available which works in the same way as a mobile
                phone contract does.
              </p>
              <p>
                You pay in advance for a set number of minutes per session or, per
                week, or per month as agreed by debit or credit card or online
                banking.
              </p>
              <p>
                We have interpreters available to offer you the interpreting services
                you have purchased. VRS minutes can be used as and when necessary
                during the month. Call prices may vary slightly depending on the
                package agreed for your service needs.
              </p>
              <h3 class="uppercase">6. Access to Work Grant Claim Process</h3>
              <p>
                If you receive an ATW Grant, we will send you an invoice for the
                agreed Subscription service at the end of each month AND/OR and the
                number of minutes used during the month.
              </p>
              <p>
                This will be attached to an ATW Support worker claim form which will
                be completed by us to confirm that we have made the services
                available, whether this is VRS or F2F or both.
                <br />
